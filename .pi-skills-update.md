# Skill Scripts Shebang Update

## Summary

Updated all skill script shebangs from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for better portability.

## Changes

The following skill scripts in `.pi/skills/*/scripts/*.sh` have been updated:

1. ci-workflow/scripts/ci-wait.sh
2. create-worktree/scripts/create_worktree.sh
3. delete-environment/scripts/delete_env.sh
4. github-graphql-api/scripts/add-sub-issue.sh
5. github-issue-dependency/scripts/issue-dependency.sh
6. github-issue-state-management/scripts/issue-state.sh
7. pr-and-cleanup/scripts/pr_and_cleanup.sh
8. pr-merge-workflow/scripts/pr-merge-full.sh
9. release-workflow/scripts/release.sh
10. sanitizer/scripts/sanitize.sh

## Why

- `#!/bin/bash` assumes bash is always at `/bin/bash`, which is not true on all systems
- `#!/usr/bin/env bash` searches PATH for bash, making scripts more portable
- This aligns with the convention already used in pi-issue-runner's main scripts
